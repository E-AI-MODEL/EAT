# EAT
EAT is a minimal, TOON-inspired Prompt-Structured Notation (PSN) for LLM system prompts. It preserves nuance through exact/locked fields, provides predictable agent behavior, and enables compact, human-readable definitions of roles, tools, workflows, styles, and safety rules. Domain-agnostic, token-efficient, and designed for agent builders.
